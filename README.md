# Button Shop

A simple web application that lets users create and store different types of button orders locally.

Users can select buttons that correspond to a price(Red = $1.23, Green = $3.75, Blue = $2.50). 

Users can then input the quantity for that order and have the option to donate to a charity which rounds up their total.

The order is then stored locally, and donations are highlighted.

Users also have the option to view/delete their orders.
